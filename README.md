# React Blog 📝

This is a simple blog application built using **React** as a practice project to improve my React skills.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This blog app allows users to view blog posts dynamically. It helps me learn and practice:
- React components and props
- State management with \`useState\`
- Rendering lists dynamically with \`.map()\`
- Handling events in React
- Conditional rendering
- React hooks (as the project progresses)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (for styling)
- JSON (for mock blog data)


## 📌 Features to Implement
✅ Display a list of blog posts  
✅ Use props and state to manage data  
✅ Implement routing for individual blog pages  
✅ Fetch blog data from an API 

⬜ Add interactivity (like deleting posts)  
  

## 🌱 Learning Goals
- Understand React component-based architecture
- Learn how to manage state and props effectively
- Experiment with React hooks and lifecycle methods
- Implement basic routing using React Router
